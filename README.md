# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regression
Ridge and Lasso regression are two common techniques used in linear regression to handle multicollinearity and perform feature selection.

1.Ridge Regression-  
Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. 
Ridge regression is effective when there is multicollinearity in the data, meaning that predictor variables are correlated.

2.Lasso Regression-
Lasso regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function, which is proportional to the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients. 
Lasso regression is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data where many features may not contribute significantly to the prediction.
