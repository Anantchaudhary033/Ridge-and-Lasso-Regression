# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regression
Ridge and Lasso regression are two common techniques used in linear regression to handle multicollinearity and perform feature selection.
# Ridge-  
Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. 
Ridge regression is effective when there is multicollinearity in the data, meaning that predictor variables are correlated.
